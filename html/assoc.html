<H4>DESCRIPTION</H4><PRE>
       Attempt to reconstruct a potentially corrupted image  from
       a  McCulloch-Pitts feedback neural network that acts as an
       associative memory.  The weights of the network are deter-
       mined  via Hebb's rule after reading in multiple patterns.
       Weights can be pruned either by size,  locality,  or  ran-
       domly.

<H4>MISCELLANY</H4><PRE>
       All  pattern files must be in the PBM file format. You can

       request that multiple patterns be stored into the  weights
       by using the -pfile option multiple time.

       The dimensions of the stored patterns and the test pattern
       must be identical.

       For weight pruning, the program first checks to see  if  a
       weight  is  "non-local" which means that for a weight that
       connects two neurons either  the  row  indices  or  column
       indices differ by the amount greater than the value speci-
       fied by the -local option.  (If a value for  local  -local
       is  zero,  then  all weights are used.)  Next, the program
       prunes weights that are too small in size as specified  by
       the  -cut  option.   If  a weights has not been removed at
       this stage, then it will still be pruned with  probability
       as specified by the -pprob option.

<H4>BUGS</H4><PRE>
       No  sanity  checks  are performed to make sure that any of
       the options make sense.
