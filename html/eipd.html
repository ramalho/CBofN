<H4>DESCRIPTION</H4><PRE>
       The ecological iterated Prisoner's  Dilemma  is  simulated
       over time according to the specified parameters.  At every
       time step the population of each strategy is calculated as
       a  function  of  the  expected  scores  earned against all
       strategies weighted by the populations of  the  opponents.
       Possible  strategies  include  'Always Cooperate,' 'Always
       Defect,'

<H4>PAYOFFS</H4><PRE>
       The payoff matrix for the Prisoner's Dilemma game is  usu-
       ally expressed as:
                                 Player B's Move
                            +-----------+-----------+
            Player A's Move | cooperate |  defect   |
                +-----------+-----------+-----------+
                | cooperate |  CC, CC   |  CD, DC   |
                +-----------+-----------+-----------+
                |    defect |  DC, CD   |  DD, DD   |
                +-----------+-----------+-----------+

       where  the  table entries are (A's payoff, B's payoff) and
       CC, CD, DC, and DD are the reward, sucker, temptation, and
       punish payoffs, respectively.  For each of these four out-
       comes you will probably want the payoffs  to  reflect  the
       relationships:

            (DC &gt; CC &gt; DD &gt; CD) and ((CD + DC) / 2 &lt; CC).

<H4>MISCELLANY</H4><PRE>
       random noise (via the -noise option) manifests itself as a
       cell making a randomly selected move in  a  single  round.
       In  this  case,  both the cell whose action was altered as
       well as that cell's opponents "remember" what  the  random
       move was on the next round.

       During  each time step, every strategy plays against every
       other strategy as well as against itself.

       The initial population levels for all strategies  will  be
       normalized, so the scaling of the option values is irrele-
       vant.


</PRE>
<H4>BUGS</H4><PRE>
       No sanity checks are performed to make sure  that  any  of
       the options make sense.
