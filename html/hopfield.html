<H4>DESCRIPTION</H4><PRE>
       Solve a task assignment problem via a Hopfield neural net-
       work  while  plotting  the activations of the neurons over
       time.  The program uses the K-out-of-N  rule  for  setting
       the external inputs and synapse strength of the neurons.

<H4>MISCELLANY</H4><PRE>
       As  mentioned  before, the weights and external inputs are

       set according to the K-out-of-N rule which states that  if
       we  have N neurons in a mutually connected sub-network and
       that we wish this subset to converge with exactly  K  neu-
       rons  activated,  then  each neuron should be connected to
       every other neuron with a weights of  -2  and  receive  an
       external  input  of (2K - 1).  Since we must produce solu-
       tions that look like permutation matrices, each neuron  is
       in  2  K-out-of-N  subsets, one for the column and one for
       the row.  Thus, all neurons inhibit all other  neurons  in
       the  same  column  or  row  with  -2 and must (on average)
       receive a net input of 2 since they are all in  two  sets.
       The external inputs are slightly adjusted to favor neurons
       that represent more productive task performers.   See  the
       source code for more details.

<H4>BUGS</H4><PRE>
       No  sanity  checks  are performed to make sure that any of
       the options make sense.

       The final cost of the solution is printed at  the  end  of
       the  simulation;  however, no check is done to insure that
       the system has actually converged.  Hence,  it  may  print
       out nonsense results.
