<H4>DESCRIPTION</H4><PRE>
       The  time evolution of the hodgepodge machine is simulated
       and plotted according to the  specified  parameters.   The
       neighborhood  of  a  cell  can  optionally  include or not
       include diagonal cells  in  a  3x3  area;   Moreover,  the
       neighborhood  can  also  wrap around the edges so that the
       grid is topologically toroidal.  With a proper  choice  of
       parameters, this system resembles the Belousov-Zhabotinsky
       reaction which forms self-perpetuating spirals in  a  lat-
       tice.   See  the  RULES section of the manual pages or the
       source code for an explanation of  how  the  cells  change
       over time.

<H4>RULES</H4><PRE>
       If  each cell can be in one of N states (labelled 0 to n -
       1), then cells in state 0 are ``healthy,'' cells in  state
       n - 1 are ``ill,'' and all other cells are ``infected.''

       Within  a  cell's  neighborhood,  let  Nill,  Ninf, and S,
       denote the number of ill cells,  the  number  of  infected
       cells,  and  the  sum  of the states of all neighbors plus
       this cell's state.  The next state is  determined  by  the
       three rules:

          Healthy: floor( Ninf / k1 ) + floor( Nill / k2 )

          Infected: floor( S / ( Ninf + 1 ) ) + g

          Ill: magically becomes healthy, thus 0.

       Where  k1,  k2,  and g are the parameters specified by the
       command line options.


</PRE>
<H4>MISCELLANY</H4><PRE>
       If you move from (to) an 8 cell neighborhood to (from) a 4
       cell  neighborhood try dividing (multiplying) k1 and k2 by
       2 to produce a similar time evolution that  occurred  with
       the previous neighborhood size.

       For some reason, 4 cell neighborhoods seem to produce pat-
       terns with more spirals.

       This simulation can be frustratingly slow at times, so you
       may  wish to use the -freq option to cut down on the over-
       head of plotting the states.


</PRE>
<H4>BUGS</H4><PRE>
       No sanity checks are performed to make sure  that  any  of
       the options make sense.
