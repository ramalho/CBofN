<H4>DESCRIPTION</H4><PRE>
       An L-system is computed according to the specified  axiom,
       rules,  and step angle.  The L-system axiom is recursively
       expanded for the specified depth, with 'F', 'G',  and  '|'
       actions  resulting in movement of the virtual plotter, and
       '+' and '-' commands resulting in rotation of the  virtual
       plotter.   See  the  RULES  section of the manual page for
       more information on the format for legal rules.

<H4>RULES</H4><PRE>
       The L-system rules should always  take  the  form  "x=..."
       where  "x"  is  a  letter  and  the remaining portion is a
       sequence of turtle graphics  commands,  which  operate  as
       described below.

       'F'  is  the draw forward command, which moves the plotter
       forward by a fixed length, drawing a  line  from  the  old
       position to the new position.

       'G'  (Go  Forward)  is  similar to 'F', but only moves the
       plotter and does not draw a line.

       '+' and '-' turn the plotter to the right (or left)  by  a
       fixed  angle  determined by the -da switch.  If an integer
       precedes the '+' or '-' symbol, then  the  plotter  effec-
       tively makes that number of right-hand turns.

       '['  saves  the  current position and angle of the plotter
       for later use, which is restored by the ']' command.

       '|' move the turtle forward by a length computed from  the
       execution  depth,  drawing a line from the old position to
       the new.  Thus, this command is similar to 'F' but  it  is
       not  recursively expanded.  If DS is the value supplied by
       the <B>-ds</B> switch, then the step size will be proportional to
       DS^depth.   This allows for certain types of figures to be
       drawn that would otherwise be difficult to express without
       this command.

<H4>MISCELLANY</H4><PRE>
       If you are using a UNIX command shell, be  sure  to  quote
       any  rules  with brackets so that the shell passes them to
       the program correctly.


</PRE>
<H4>BUGS</H4><PRE>
       No sanity checks are performed to make sure  that  any  of
       the options make sense.

       The  border  size is only approximately calculated because
       the author felt a bit lazy at the  time  of  writing  this
       program.  However, it's pretty close for most values.
