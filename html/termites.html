<H4>DESCRIPTION</H4><PRE>
       Simulate  a  population of termites which do a random walk
       while possibly carrying a wood chip.  Under normal circum-
       stances, the termites will self-organize and move the wood
       chips into piles without a global leader.   The  termites'
       behavior  is  dictated by the following set of rules: If a
       termite is not carrying anything  and  she  bumps  into  a
       chip,  then  she picks it up, reverses direction, and con-
       tinues with the random walk.  If she is  carrying  a  chip
       and  bumps into another, she drops her chip, turns around,
       and starts walking again.  Otherwise, she just does a ran-
       dom walk whether she is carrying a chip or not.

              Width of the plot in pixels.

       <B>-inv</B>   Invert all colors?

       <B>-mag</B> <I>integer</I>
              Magnification factor.

<H4>MISCELLANY</H4><PRE>
       The  walking  pattern  of  the  termites is not actually a
       strict random walk.   Instead,  at  each  time  step  they

       randomly  turn  -45, 0, or 45 degrees with equal probabil-
       ity.

<H4>BUGS</H4><PRE>
       No sanity checks are performed to make sure  that  any  of
       the options make sense.
