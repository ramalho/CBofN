.SH DESCRIPTION
A time series data set is generated by a one-dimensional map 
according to the specified options.  See the MAPS section of the manual 
page for details of what maps are supported.  User defined maps can be 
added to the file maps1d.c, but you must recompile the program. 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-points\ \fIinteger\fP
Number of points to plot.
.IP \fB\-skip\ \fIinteger\fP
Number of initial points to skip.
.IP \fB\-r\ \fIdouble\fP
Value for the r parameter.
.IP \fB\-aux\ \fIdouble\fP
Auxiliary map parameter.
.IP \fB\-x0\ \fIdouble\fP
Initial value for x.
.IP \fB\-func\ \fIstring\fP
Map function to use (one of 'log', 'tent', 'sin', or 'gauss').
.SH MAPS
The following four one-dimensional maps are allowed:
.IP Logistic\ Map:
x(t+1) = 4 * r * x(t) * (1.0 - x(t))
.IP Tent\ Map:
x(t+1) = (x(t) <= 0.5) ? 2 * r * x(t) : 2r * (1.0 - x(t))
.IP Sine\ Map:
x(t+1) = sin(x(t) * PI * aux * 2 * r) / 2 + 0.5
.IP Gaussian\ Map:
x(t+1) = r * exp(-aux * (x(t) - 0.5) * (x(t) - 0.5))
.LP
See the file "maps1d.c" to see how to add user-defined maps.
.SH MISCELLANY
Use a plotting program (such as gnuplot) or a spreadsheet
to plot the data.
.SH BUGS
No sanity checks are performed to make sure that any of the
options make sense.
