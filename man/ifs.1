.SH DESCRIPTION
An affine fractal is computed via an Iterated Functional System. 
The rules must be supplied from a file with each line 
consisting of six values (A-F) such that the values of A-D describe 
a 2x2 matrix (A, B; C, D), while E and F describes a 2x1 column vector 
(E; F).
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-infile\ \fIstring\fP
Data input file.
.IP \fB\-width\ \fIinteger\fP
Width of the plot in pixels.
.IP \fB\-height\ \fIinteger\fP
Height of the plot in pixels.
.IP \fB\-border\ \fIinteger\fP
Number of pixels in border.
.IP \fB\-its\ \fIinteger\fP
Number of iterations.
.IP \fB\-skip\ \fIinteger\fP
Number of iteration to skip.
.IP \fB\-term\ \fIstring\fP
How to plot points.
.IP \fB\-inv
Invert colors?
.IP \fB\-mag\ \fIinteger\fP
Magnification factor.
.SH MISCELLANY
There is a shell script called 'ifscma' supplied with the source
code that has a simple interface that allows you to reference
sets of predefined rules by name.  You may also wish to see the
author's book, "The Computational Beauty of Nature," for
some more examples.
.SH BUGS
No sanity checks are performed to make sure that any of the
options make sense.

The maximum number of affine rules is determined by the
constant MAXRULES, which you may need to adjust under exceptional
circumstances.
